Community Addons
================

This repository curates a list of community addons mostly from OCA that the OpenG2P ERP depends on.

@TODO - We need to switch to using [git-aggregator](https://pypi.org/project/git-aggregator) to pull in modules into development so we utilize the same flow as the docker image
